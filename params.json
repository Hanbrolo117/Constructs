This will hopefully help out Dart Devs who need extra data structures with it's own methods already implemented.\r\n\r\n### So Far\r\nAs of writing, this project's sole focus is on the nth dimensional matrix. However other data structures are being planned out for implementation!\r\n\r\n### Author\r\nKyle Ferguson is the Sole Author of the Dart Constructs project.\r\n\r\n### Contact\r\nIf you would like to contact me to get in touch, voice a concern, etc. shoot me an email at singularitysystemsdev@gmail.com.\r\n\r\n###Special Thanks\r\nFinally, I would like to thank cups of delicious coffee as well as plenty of bowls of cereal. &#9749;",
